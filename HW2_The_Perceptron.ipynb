A lower learning rate can sometimes help the model converge more smoothly and avoid overshooting the minimum, but it can also drastically slow down the training process. The reduced learning rate may not have allowed the model to update its weights and biases enough to learn successfully from the doubled dataset size in the same number of epochs. This sluggish convergence may result in underfitting, in which the model fails to reflect the underlying patterns in the bigger dataset.\n",
